title: "Destruction"

I am not afraid of death

I am not afraid of pain

I am not afraid to die

I am not afraid

I will not let them keep me down

I will not let them bring me down

I will never give up

I will fight back

I will take my freedom

I will make my own way

I will do what they could not do

I will live

I will never forget who I am

I will not allow them to control me

I will not stop screaming until I am free
